# Arduino Hands-on Workshop
Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

In this workshop you will be introduced to:

- micro controllers and the Arduino 
- Arduino Pinout
- Controlling devices 
- Time controlled devices 
- Introduction to breakout boards (using IR proximity sensor)
- Hands-on LED Light On/Off function with IR proximity sensor 
- Hands-on assignment (project)
